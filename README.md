## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I'm a Fullstack Developer with a deep passion for uniting **design and functionality**.  
I strive to build tools and interfaces that not only work reliably but are also **aesthetically pleasing** and **enjoyable to use**. Great UI/UX should feel intuitive â€” not require lengthy tutorials â€” and guide users naturally every step of the way.

With a solid background in web development, I specialize in crafting **modular**, **responsive** applications using technologies like **PHP, JavaScript and Vue.js**. I love creating solutions where **clarity, usability**, and **clean code** go hand in hand.

Outside the tech world, I find balance through sports â€” it helps me stay focused, energized, and creatively inspired. I'm always curious, motivated, and excited to take on new challenges.
